            <p>Check out this video I made about my KEMET Award winning ($500!) senior design project! </p>

			<p> I talk more about this project in my resume (<a href="Resume.pdf"> here! </a>) but I helped spec out the parts, designed and ordered the demultiplexing circuit for 
			 motor control, fabricated the majority of the electronics seen in the video, and implemented the project inside the guitar case. Below is a printout of the circuit that I'm quite proud of.</p>

			<p>  I have to give a lot of credit to my team mates for knocking it out of the park with the fast fourier transform algorithms, and for pursuing design methodology
			that was simple but always exceeded our criteria. Thanks to them we won the KEMET Award, a $500 prize that goes to the project that is voted on by a variety of staff and alumni to be the best.</p>

            <p>Having a vehicle to promote yourself through is crucial and here's how I got my website up and running. </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Hosting Content</h3>
            <p>The way I have my content hosted (and it's good for new people who need a static site with nothing in the background) is via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, which is free.</p>
            <p> As long as you have your content set up as the landing page above dictates, anything hosted at yourname dot github dot com should look good.
			<h3>Custom URL</h3>
            <p>I bought my cool url from <a href="https://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a>. For a personal webpage, a url for a year is probably cheaper than coffee for a week. </p>
            <p>The next step is to direct your DNS settings in name cheap to your github page. That shouldn't really be difficult, And there's numerous tutorials on line to set it up.</p>
            <h3>Content and CSS</h3>
			<p> I'm using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> bootstrap </a> for my css solutions at the moment. It's very customizable, free, and I prefer the look of a blog style format for my portfolio.</p>
			<h3>Goals for the future</h3>
            <p>It shouldn't be hard to set up email forwarding through namecheap. I'll get on that in a bit, and post how to do it here. </p>
			<h3>Finished Product </h3>
			<p>  Well I built a dang website! Check it out at <a href="index.html">mirrorshades.global </a>, but you're already here so you've probably seen it by now. Wow!</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title"><a href="progman.html">Program Interruption Manager </a></h2>

            <p>I built a cool and useful thing for the radio station, using on-hand documentation and some brightly colored buttons. Check it out! </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Live Audio streams at WSBF go through a machine that  adds a delay. This is so if a mistake on air occurs there is a enough time to prevent the mistake from going out 
			 on air. Unfortunately, the only available location for the unit was difficult to reach, especially in the cramped desk space. Additionally, we had users in wheelchairs who were unable to access inital location.
			 The finished product is an extension of the user interface for that delay module that was placed in a sensible position, thanks to an empty expansion panel on the mixing board.</p>
            <img src="/controlboard/2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<h3>Construction</h3>
			<p>In the documentation for the Program Interruption Manager was the pinout for the serial port of the unit. With a pins jumped, it would send auxilliary control of the unit
			to addtional pins. The original diagram had the indicator lights (if a button was pressed for example) separate from the switches.</p>
            <p>I wanted to incorporate lights and UI into one unit. As i was working on restoring a vintage arcade machine at the time, I picked up some very cool looking Ultralux Chrome Illuminated Pushbuttons from <a href="http://www.ultimarc.com"> This arcade supply store</a>. </p>
            <p>I chose the specific color buttons you can see here due to them most closely resembling the original panel of the manager. </p>
            <img src="/controlboard/3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

            <h3>Finished Product and Potential Expansions</h3>
			<p> The serial port is also capable of pushing how much time is left on the delay module to a microcontroller. However, at the time I was unsure how to interface with the older protocol as well as a seven segment display. I've recommended an expansion
			of that caliber to be done as a good project for future Chief Engineers at WSBF-FM Clemson. You can see me hardstyling above the finished product below.</p>
