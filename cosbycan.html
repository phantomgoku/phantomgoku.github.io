			<p> For spring break 2012, my good friend Jordan and I were back in our hometown. With a week off, we were dying for a fun and creative project.
			We had the idea for a pistol-grip/'gun' idea as a base. We pitched the idea of a 'applause gun' to each other but that didn't have the sincerity we were looking for.
			We had to consider our time constraints and our budget (about $15 and a sandwich), so we couldn't really do anything too intricate.</p>
			<h3>Sourcing our parts</h3>
			<p> Jordan and I went to a local industrial sized thrift store called <a href="http://scrapexchange.org/"> The Scrap Exchange</a> 
			and picked up a portable tape recorder as well as a gun shell for a Nintendo Wii Remote. We decided we wanted to use tapes because at the time it was 
			much easier to recorder a loop of whatever audio clips we wanted instead of purchasing and working with a microcontroller. Sometimes brutally simple stuff works the best.
			<h3> Assembly</h3>
			<p> Construction was as simple as wiring up a contact switch to the leads of the recorder's battery compartment, and sandwiching that behind the trigger spring.
			Since this was an inordinately goofy project, care was taken to gussy it up with decals. Jordan was pursuing a care
			er in video editing (which has been quite successful!) 
			and you can see the completed handiwork above. Carefully note the leopard print p>
